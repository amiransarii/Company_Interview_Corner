Hi,

I have attended interview for OSS System Development & Support Specialist post, in July 2020 in Maxis and I cleared it successfully.  
Unfortunately, I did not join because I already got job offer from different company before declaring final result of the Maxis.

####Basic Skills Needed###.
1. Core Java 
2. Spring Framework
3. Hibernate
4. Oracle/MySQL 

However, I would like to share my experience with you so that, It can help you tackle this interview.
There were total four rounds for this position and each one was challenging.

1.Project Manager Discussion:  It was first round, where project manager wanted to know my background, problem solving skills and experience  
  in that project, which he is going to hire for.

2. Coding Challenge:  After first round cleared, another round was coding challenge round where I received coding question and had to solve 
live and within time. This session was recording, and Maxis has its own platform same has hacker rank. I have attached the format document please 
look into it. More focus is required for this round and also basic skills of Java.

3.HR Round : Third round was a HR round, who would like to know more about me.

4.Management Round: Final round was management round, where higher authority would like to discuss in more details and how 
can I be more suitable for this position and how can I help company etc.
